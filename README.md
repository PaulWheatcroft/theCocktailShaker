## User Experience (UX)

3 sets of target personas have been identified:

- Someone has some ingredients and wants to be inspired to make a cocktail
- Someone doesn't have ingredients but does have an idea of the ingredients they would like to use
- Someone just wants to be inspired by a cocktail choice

### Someone who has some ingredients

<img src="images/" style="margin: 0;">

As someone who has some ingredients in their drinks cabinet I would like to:
1. Find a cocktail I can make with the ingredients I have available
- The result needs to let me know all the ingredients I need to use
- The result need to show me how to make the cocktail
- The result needs to show me a picture of the cocktail
2. If I'm not inspired by the first choice I would like to find another option using the same ingredients
3. If I like what I find I would like to email the full ingredients list including instructions of how to make the drink to an email address of my choice.
4. If I don't find any drink that inspire me I would like to start again

### Someone who has an idea of what they would like in a cocktail

Mocking up of the site was initially done on pen and paper and then brought to life using Figma.

A Figma wireframe for each page can be found in the links Below.

## Testing

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

####	Music Enthusiast Visitor Goals 

####	Musician Visitor Goals

####	Live Music Promoter Visitor Goals

Both HTML and CSS have been validated via

- W3C [Validation](https://validator.w3.org/nu/)

Accessibility was checked at [www.webaccessibility.com]

Responsiveness was checked thought using the Google dev tools and [www.responsinator.com](

A code review was posted in the Code Institute peer-code-review channel.

I used a wide group of friends and family to test the user stories across the following operating systems and browsers.

- Windows (multiple computers)
    - Internet Explorer 11
    - Microsoft Edge
    - Chrome
    - Firefox
    - Opera
- macOS (MacBook Air and iMac)
    - Safari
    - Chrome
- Android (OPPO Reno 2, Nokia 3.2, Huawei P Smart 2019)
    - Native OPPO handset browser
    - Chrome browser
- iOS (iPhone 7, iPhoneX, iPhone SE)
    - Safari

Functional testing was carried out against every element to ensure everything worked and was linked as expected before user tested was started. This was recorded in [functional-testing.xlsx](functional-testing.xlsx). Another tab was added after user testing to regression test functionality following changes through the user testing feedback.

## Bugs and issues
